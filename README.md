## How the systems are managed

All system READMEs follow the [same template](SYSTEM_TEMPLATE.md), which contains the following sections:

- **Use cases:** A list of use cases and business rules that must be followed in the system
- **System design:** A diagram showing how the system must be structured
- **Technologies:** A list of technologies the system uses and their purposes
- **Commands:** A list of commands to interact with the system

Systems also have GitHub tags so we can filter them

## How to practice systems

You can create your own repository and copy the system README to the README of that new repository

From there, implement all use cases and strictly follow the system design. You have the freedom to choose other
technologies and commands for your implementation

Once you've completed your implementation, you can share it in the [Show and Tell]() topic. You can also see
other implementations and compare them to yours

## About concepts

In addition to being a practical project, Gopher Systems also provides [Concepts](https://github.com/gopher-systems/guide/tree/main/concepts), which are nothing
more than notes on various subjects related to systems and software

These concepts can be referenced in the systems' READMEs, to make them better documented and understandable

## How to contribute

You can contribute by creating new issues in the system repositories. If the issue is related to a bug
or improvement, you can also make a pull request resolving the issue

## Licenses

All systems are MIT licensed
